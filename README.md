#Design Principles
<i>Copied from Head First Design Patterns by Eric Freeman</i>
1. Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same. 
The first of many design principles. We'll spend more time on these throughout the book.
1. Program to an interface, not an implementation.
1. Favor composition over inheritance.

#Observer Pattern
1. The <b>Observer Pattern</b> defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
